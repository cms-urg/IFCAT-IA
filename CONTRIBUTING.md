# Contribution Guidelines

Thank you for considering to contribute! We are happy to have you here. Before starting, just note that we expect you to know the basics of JavaScript and Node.js.

### Development Environment

It is recommended that you code in macOS or Linux, Windows may run into small issues and you may find installing Redis a bit tricky.

* Node.js v10.x LTS, you can install this using [nvm](https://github.com/creationix/nvm).
* MongoDB, download it [here](https://www.mongodb.com/).
* Redis, download and build from [here](https://redis.io/).
* Git!
* Your favourite IDE.

### Identity Atheneum Credentials

You probably don't want to setup [Identity Atheneum](https://github.com/junthehacker/Identity-Atheneum) as well, as it can get complicated.

Please contact me at `me at jackzh dot com` to obtain an application key you can directly use with our UTSC tracademic server.

### What Are You Interested In?

There are many areas of the project you can work on!

#### Express HTTP Backend

You can find the code within `Controllers`, `Enums`, `Middleware`, `Routers` and `Models` folders.

This part of the project handles all http requests and rendering HTML pages.

#### EJS Templates

This is where we describe how admin panel and student portals look. If you are new to the project, and only know HTML, this is a great starting point! You can find the code under `Views`.

#### React.js

Want to dig deep into some JavaScript frameworks? Our student quiz interface is built using React. You can find the code under `Views/Student/quiz`.

#### WebSocket

Interested in developing WebSocket services? You can find WebSocket logic scattered around the project. This is more advanced, and we recommend you get familiar with the whole codebase first.

### Issues

You don't have to open an issue if it is a very small problem (typo or just general cleanup). But if you want to add a new feature, please open an issue and get approved first before working on it.

If you found an issue that you are interested in, and nobody has taken it yet, please feel free to comment on the issue expressing your interest!
